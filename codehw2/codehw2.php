This loop will keep "tossing a coin" or in other words running mt_rand(0,1) to yield a random 1 (heads) or 0 (tails) result, which becomes the value of $toss. If it comes up tails, it just starts over. If it comes up heads, it branches off into another loop that tries for another heads. If the second loop comes up heads, the whole thing stops. If, however, it comes up tails, it goes back to the very start of the loop. The $last variable "saves" the most recent result, and is the trigger for branching off into the second loop or returning to the original loop. In other words, if the last flip came up heads, $last will be set to 1 and the loop will branch off into a "while ($last==1)" loop, or put another way, a "while (last toss came up heads)" loop. The $counter simply keeps track of how many tosses have been made. */
